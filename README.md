# ZTH_Reform_Analytics_Hackathon

This repository contains a data-driven analysis and visualization project focused on **Import Substitution Impact Analysis for Electrical Machinery (HS Code 85)** in Nigeria. The project was developed during the **Zion Tech Hub Reform Analytics Hackathon**, and it aims to uncover strategic opportunities for local production, fiscal optimization, and industrial development.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze historical import and tax data (2019–2024) for key HS codes under Chapter 85.
- Identify high-growth and high-dependency import categories.
- Model fiscal savings under 20–30% import substitution scenarios.
- Estimate job creation and industrial growth impacts.
- Recommend strategic allocation of public investment (₦100B stimulus).

## 📊 Key Findings (30% Substitution Scenario)

| Metric             | Value                  |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Fiscal Savings** | ₦236.33 billion        |
| **Job Creation**   | ₦7.09 billion          |
| **Industrial Growth** | ₦11.82 billion     |

- **Top Targets for Substitution**: Solar cells, static converters, electric conductors, diesel generators, and data transmission machines.
- **Strategic Allocation**: ₦100B fund proposed across high-impact product categories using a scoring framework based on fiscal value, import sensitivity, and sector readiness.

# ZTH_Reform_Analytics_Hackathon – Import Substitution Impact Analysis for HS Code 85

This repository presents a strategic, data-driven solution to Nigeria’s overdependence on imported electrical machinery. Developed during the **Zion Tech Hub Reform Analytics Hackathon**, the project explores how import substitution in **HS Code 85** (Electrical Machinery and Equipment) can reduce fiscal leakage, boost industrial capacity, and create jobs.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In 2019, Nigeria imported over **₦783.8 billion** worth of electrical machinery (HS Code 85). A large portion of this import value is concentrated in a few product categories, many of which can be feasibly substituted through local assembly or production. This project uses historical import and tariff data to model how strategic import substitution could unlock **fiscal savings**, **industrial growth**, and **employment gains**—while guiding investment decisions like the ₦100B economic stimulus.

## ❓ Problem Statement

> **How can Nigeria reduce fiscal leakage and enhance local production by strategically substituting key imports under HS Code 85?**

- High dependency on a narrow range of imported machinery.
- Untapped industrial and innovation potential in power systems and electronics.
- Weak alignment between trade data insights and fiscal policy or industrial strategy.

---

## 💡 Solution Approach (My Process)

1. **Data Cleaning & Structuring** (Excel, Python):
   - Cleaned raw import and tariff data for 2019.
   - Focused on HS Code 85: Electrical machinery and equipment.

2. **Analysis & Modeling** (Python - Pandas, Seaborn, Prophet):
   - Identified high-value and fast-growing import items.
   - Modeled fiscal and economic impact of 30% import substitution.

3. **Visualization & Reporting** (Power BI):
   - Created dashboards and insight summaries for key stakeholders.

4. **Recommendations**:
   - Aligned data insights with potential public investment strategies and policy reforms.

## 📌 Strategic Recommendations

### 🎯 Trade & Industrial Policy
- **Support Local Assembly & Manufacturing** for generators, conductors, and solar systems.
- **Develop Targeted Import Substitution Plans** per high-impact product category.

### 🎯 Fiscal Optimization
- **Close Tax Gaps** with real-time tracking of undervalued imports.
- **Harmonize Tariffs** to support strategic products while disincentivizing overreliance.
- **Digitize Customs Reporting** for improved policy monitoring.

### 🎯 Investment Strategy
- **Deploy ₦100B Economic Stimulus** using a scoring framework based on:
  - Fiscal impact potential
  - National Priorities
- **Incentivize R&D & Local Innovation** through matching grants and tax credits.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Next Steps

### Data Gaps or Assumptions
- Focused on one year (2019); results could be strengthened by multi-year analysis.
- Substitution assumptions do not account for elasticities or consumer preference shifts.

### Areas for Further Study
- Validate local production capacity and cost of substitution per product group.
- Extend fiscal modeling to capture dynamic effects (inflation, FX impacts, job quality).
- Engage policymakers to co-create implementation frameworks and monitoring tools.
